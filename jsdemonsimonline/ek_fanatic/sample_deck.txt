# This is a sample deck file. It is divided in 3 parts, separated by a blank line
# Oh, lines starting with a # are comments and are ignored.
# First up is the player section. Level, with optionally a name, separated by a ;. So you can either write just a number
# or a number followed by a ; and then a name.

# Here is the card section. Just write the full name of the card here. Optionally you can pass a level and an evolve skill.
# Default level is 10, and no evolve skill.
